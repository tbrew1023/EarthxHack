extrensic motivation vs intrensic motivation

we're intrensically motivated when we find something inherently satisfying and interesting

...

how do you design a game?:

- goals
    . concrete
    . achievable
    . rewarding

- emotions
    . joy
    . enthusiasm
    . pride
    . triumph
    . love
    . surprise

- controls
    - rapid and robust controls

- toys (make fun toys and combine them into games) ***
    . is it fun even without a goal?
    . playful exploration?
    . creates moments of pleasant surprise?

- flow
    . intense and focused concentration on the present
    . merging of action and awareness
    . loss of reflective self-conciousness
    . sense of personal control
    . distortion of temporal experience
    . activity becomes intrinsically motivating

CONDITIONS FOR FLOW
    . Knowing what to do next
    . Knowing how to do it
    . Freedom from distractions
    . Clear and immediate feedback
    . Balance of challenge + skill
